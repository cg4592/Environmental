            <h2>Welcome to the Jungle:</h2>
            <p>Wilderness is what is found in the undiscovered, or rather the discovered but unfamiliar. Wilderness might exist only in what is untouched by humans, but humans have exclusively shaped New York City and it is the wildest place I know. Throughout the semester I have attempted to untangle the web that is the neighborhoods in this city, and in doing so have discovered even more questions. I learned that seemingly wild things are the results of meticulous planning, and seemingly mundane things are the results of generations of human movement and growth. Wilderness is associated with nature, but this city defies wilderness’s simplistic definition. Welcome to an almanac that captures the smallest snapshot of the wilderness that exists within this city. Welcome to the concrete jungle.</p>

            <h2>An Exploration of How New York City Has Been Divided</h2>
            <p>“New York City is the most divided city in the world, home to both the richest and poorest neighborhoods in the country separated not by miles but by city blocks. The differences between neighborhoods in New York City are not created by chance, but instead by conscious greed and proactive indifference.” (Miles Apart, Worlds Apart, 1) <br><br>
            While neighborhoods look as though they randomly pop up and flourish like an uninhibited garden, they are actually the result of careful weeding and pruning. <br><br>
            “…heat in New York is distributed unequally, and its distribution follows other patterns of inequality, including race, income, air quality, and access to air-conditioning” (Why an East Harlem Street is 31 Degrees Hotter Than Central Park West, 5) <br><br>
            Even nature itself has bent to the will of inequitable city planning. Sometimes wilderness appears in the lack of wilderness. Humans have created something so unnatural that it has looped back around. <br><br>
            “A conscious choice was made to elevate one neighborhood while harming another.“ (Miles Apart, Worlds Apart, 3) <br><br>
            “…the ownership rates on Park Avenue from 86th - 97th (73% White) are 35% more than the homes between 97th - 105th (60% Hispanic). The median income of the downtown neighborhood is twenty times higher than that of its uptown neighbor.” (American Community Survey) <br><br>
            Different neighborhoods respond to the stimulus they have been exposed to for decades on end. Wilderness is defined by the natural order that governs its existence. This “concrete jungle” has had its natural order disrupted. How can we overcome this disruption? How can we restore the natural order of this jungle?</p>

            <h2>A Study in Uniting a Community</h2>
            <p>“The epicenter of two neighborhoods, three communities, and over a dozen segregated community spaces: 260 Manhattan Ave” (Neighborhood Tour, 1) <br><br>
            Sometimes wilderness is the natural division that occurs between different communities. <br><br>
            “A name has power. It can foreshadow who will be moving in. By itself, it can conjure so much: gentrification, displacement, inequality, status.“ (An Extremely Detailed Guide to an Extremely Detailed Map of New York City Neighborhoods, 2) <br><br>
            “One needs to only look at the street signs to get a sense of the divide that exists in the blocks surrounding the lot. To the south of Graham lies “Avenue of Puerto Rico,” and to the north of Graham “Via Vespucci.” (Neighborhood Tour, 1) <br><br>
            But other times wilderness is an artificial boundary that we created. And it’s up to us to redefine that boundary. <br><br>
            “A community garden is an opportunity, an obligation, and a promise. The garden that lies at 260 Manhattan Ave starkly refuses the dividing lines that exist in East Williamsburg and of the gentrification that infringes on this hub of culture, love, and unashamed living. It brings out what people have in common, instead of what separates them, working to break down the cultural barriers that have formed in the surrounding neighborhood in a way that extends far beyond the physical space of the garden.“ (Garden Proposal, 1) <br><br>
            “Just as vegetables crossed the world the past few centuries before finding a common home in NYC, so too have people of 260 Manhattan.” (Garden Proposal, 2) <br><br>
            Change can be complex, overwhelming, and scary. But sometimes it is as simple as reaching a hand out and welcoming a stranger into your life. Sometimes true wilderness is the web of connections that living things make themselves. It is the defiance of artificially created boundaries and division.</p>

            <h2>A Defiantly Hopeful View of Wilderness</h2>
            <p>“The Cross-Bronx Expressway harms both the community surrounding it and the environment as a whole. The impact of the litany of problems caused by the Expressway is felt generationally… [Capping the Cross-Bronx Expressway] would signify the city’s rededication to the environment and Bronx residents.” (Budget Proposal: Capping the Cross-Bronx Expressway, 1) <br><br>
            We have lost our sense of wilderness. But we can take it back. It just means we have to be willing to invest in it. <br><br>
            “One of the project’s greatest supporters, AOC, stated that the project would ‘take a long time, but we’re starting now.” (“Capping the Cross Bronx Expressway | Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.”) <br><br>
            “Back in 1948, Robert Moses decided to prioritize commuters to the detriment of Bronx residents. Now, the city has the opportunity to prioritize Bronx residents over a few minutes in a commute.” (Budget Proposal: Capping the Cross-Bronx Expressway, 5) <br><br>
            Our wilderness apparently seems lost, but we can earn it again. It just takes a sense of resilience, a willingness to see the future, and a defiant sense of hope.</p>

Added bonus, the little snippets of code seen here are actually from the html file that is running this website! This is in it of itself a type of wilderness!</p>
